# GateDiff

A minimalistic file comparison program and shell extension that delegates the
task of comparing files to external programs based on file extension. It
also offers basic file comparison that is geared towards binary files,
especially images.

### Why create yet another diffing program?

This project was motivated by [DiffMerge](http://sourcegear.com/diffmerge/), which
is a great program for comparing text files, yet has some annoying flaws. This is
my attempt to hide those flaws.
